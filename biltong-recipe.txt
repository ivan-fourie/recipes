Ingredients:
- 2,5 kg (5.5 pounds) lean beef (Silver Side or London Broil cut)
- 250ml vinegar (for basting)
- 60 ml (1/4 cup) coriander seeds
- 60 ml (1/4 cup) salt
- 15 ml (1 tablespoon) milled black pepper

Directions:
1. Cut the meat into strips about 2 cm x 3 cm (3/4-inch x 1 1/4-inches). 
2. Roast the coriander seeds in a dry frying pan to bring out the flavour. 
3. Crush lightly with a pestle and mortar and mix with the salt and pepper.
4. Additional spices like paprika and peri peri can be added according to your preference for spicy flavouring. 
5. Add a layer of vinegar to a glass dish and sprinkle a little of the spice mix you just made, top with a layer of meat strips, and season once more. 
6. Continue this way until meat, vinegar and seasoning are used up. 
7. Refrigerate for a day, mixing every couple of hours so that the meat flavours evenly.
8. Hang up to dry in a suitable spot (high in the garage rafters or behind the fridge where there is some movement of air). Straightened paper clips make handy fasteners!
9. Drying time is about 5 days, depending on the weather, and whether you prefer your biltong crisp or slightly moist.
